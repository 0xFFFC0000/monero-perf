Script to run two Monero nodes on single machine:
1. Main node, connected to mainnet.
2. Test node, only connected to the main node.

and benchmark runtime of different operations in test_node. Run with `--help` to see usage. Don't forget to `cp -rf ~/.bitmonero ~/.monero-test-node`, because you need two blockchains to run this benchmark.
